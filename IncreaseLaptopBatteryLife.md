## **Power Plans**

Windows 10 includes three default power plan options:
Balanced: Windows 10 balances your system performance with energy consumption in relation to your system hardware. This means your CPU speed will increase as required and reduce when not.
Power Saver: Windows 10 reduces your system performance to save battery power. Your CPU will run at lower speeds as much as possible, while other power savings come from reduced brightness, switching the screen off quicker, switching your hard drive or Wi-Fi adapter into power saving mode, and so on.
High Performance: Windows 10 cranks the performance dial up but increases power consumption. Your CPU will run at faster speeds most of the time, your screen brightness will increase, and other hardware components will not enter power-saving mode during periods of inactivity.



## **Konfiguration**

Battery Saver
The easiest way to use internal energy-saving options in Windows 10 is the use of battery saver mode. This mode helps reduce energy consumption by system resources and increases battery life. When the battery percentage comes to 20 per cent, the saver mode will be enabled automatically. And you can also edit the setting manually. Go to Battery Setting> Adjust your manually setting

Decrease Screen Brightness
High screen brightness can consume more battery life. To increase battery life for a long time, adjust the screen brightness in a lower condition. Right-click on Battery option> Adjust screen brightness> put brightness row in a lower condition.

Use Hibernation Mode
At the time of using your laptop, sometimes you may leave your laptop for a few minutes. On that time your laptop may get to sleep mode and use your battery life. When you come back to turn on your laptop, the laptop will be turned on fast and drain more battery life. You can use the Hibernation option instead of sleep mode. This mode uses less battery and helps you to use your laptop for a long time. Go to control panel> power option> change plan setting> Change advanced power setting> Battery> Critical battery action> Hibernate

Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
in time of using your laptop sometimes maybe you don’t need to turn on some options, you can disable all the option which you don’t need that. Like; Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Map, and other options. Just disable it to save your battery life for a long time.

Disable Animation and Shadow
Windows 10 uses shadows and animation for best performance and to make windows look cool, but if we want to save more battery life, we need to disable all the option due to better battery life. Go to Control panel> System> Advanced system setting> Setting> Adjust for best performance 

Disable Background Apps
Most of the Windows 10 apps run in the background to give you notification or information about new updates. But these apps can also drain your battery life, even if you don’t use them. Here we have a solution for it to disable all apps you don’t need it. Go to Setting> Privacy> Background apps> Disable/enable

Manage Startup Apps
You can disable the unnecessary startup apps to save battery life. Some apps run in a startup even we don’t need it, they can drain more battery life. Disable each in every app you don’t need. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc > Startup.
