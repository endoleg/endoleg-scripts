## **Power Plans**

Windows 10 includes three default power plan options:
Balanced: Windows 10 balances your system performance with energy consumption in relation to your system hardware. This means your CPU speed will increase as required and reduce when not.
Power Saver: Windows 10 reduces your system performance to save battery power. Your CPU will run at lower speeds as much as possible, while other power savings come from reduced brightness, switching the screen off quicker, switching your hard drive or Wi-Fi adapter into power saving mode, and so on.
High Performance: Windows 10 cranks the performance dial up but increases power consumption. Your CPU will run at faster speeds most of the time, your screen brightness will increase, and other hardware components will not enter power-saving mode during periods of inactivity.

You can right-click the battery icon and select Power Options to open the power plan Control Panel Power Options or use the shortcuts in the previous section.

**Creating a Custom Power Plan to Save Battery Life and Reduce Power Consumption**
Sometimes, none of the default power plans suit your requirements. You might use a laptop with a portable battery and want to extend both devices' battery life. In that instance, you can customize a power plan to suit you.

To create a custom power plan, select Create a power plan from the Control Panel Power Options menu, on the left of the window. Give your power plan a name and select the existing plan you want to base your plan upon.

When you create a custom power plan on Windows 10, there are a few settings for you to consider.

**1. Turn Off the Display and Put the Computer to Sleep**
The first two settings are the easiest to tweak. How long do you want your display to remain idle before switching off, and how long should the computer idle before switching to sleep mode?

On portable devices, Windows 10 provides an option for On battery and Plugged in. You might have to play around with timings to find your sweet spot. If extending your custom power plan is all about power saving and battery life preservation, set the numbers as low as possible.

Display Brightness
Wondering where the display brightness toggle setting is? Microsoft removed the option to set display brightness (as well as adaptive brightness) through your power plan in Windows 10 update 1809. The move is infuriating, as the display brightness option was another handy power saving factor you could customize.

You can still change how bright your display is without the toggle. Tap the Notification icon on the bottom right of your screen to open the Action Center. At the bottom of the panel is an adjustable brightness slider.

Don't discount the power savings an even slightly dimmed monitor will deliver. Power savings vary between monitors, but according to this tip from Harvard Law School's Energy Manager, reducing your computer monitor brightness from 100-percent down to 70-percent can "save up to 20% of the energy the monitor uses." You might not notice that 30-percent brightness reduction too much, but you'll note the extra battery power!

**2. Advanced Sleep Settings**
The sleep timer in the basic settings isn't the only adjustable option. The Windows 10 power plan advanced settings hide a host of customizable options. Select Change advanced power settings to open the advanced menu.

You'll find three additional sleep options; Sleep after, Allow hybrid sleep, and Hibernate after. Hybrid sleep attempts to combine the sleep and hibernate mode into a single mode and is intended for desktops, so ignore that for now.

## **Notebook Konfiguration**

Battery Saver
The easiest way to use internal energy-saving options in Windows 10 is the use of battery saver mode. This mode helps reduce energy consumption by system resources and increases battery life. When the battery percentage comes to 20 per cent, the saver mode will be enabled automatically. And you can also edit the setting manually. Go to Battery Setting> Adjust your manually setting

Decrease Screen Brightness
High screen brightness can consume more battery life. To increase battery life for a long time, adjust the screen brightness in a lower condition. Right-click on Battery option> Adjust screen brightness> put brightness row in a lower condition.

Use Hibernation Mode
At the time of using your laptop, sometimes you may leave your laptop for a few minutes. On that time your laptop may get to sleep mode and use your battery life. When you come back to turn on your laptop, the laptop will be turned on fast and drain more battery life. You can use the Hibernation option instead of sleep mode. This mode uses less battery and helps you to use your laptop for a long time. Go to control panel> power option> change plan setting> Change advanced power setting> Battery> Critical battery action> Hibernate

Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
in time of using your laptop sometimes maybe you don’t need to turn on some options, you can disable all the option which you don’t need that. Like; Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Map, and other options. Just disable it to save your battery life for a long time.

Disable Animation and Shadow
Windows 10 uses shadows and animation for best performance and to make windows look cool, but if we want to save more battery life, we need to disable all the option due to better battery life. Go to Control panel> System> Advanced system setting> Setting> Adjust for best performance 

Disable Background Apps
Most of the Windows 10 apps run in the background to give you notification or information about new updates. But these apps can also drain your battery life, even if you don’t use them. Here we have a solution for it to disable all apps you don’t need it. Go to Setting> Privacy> Background apps> Disable/enable

Manage Startup Apps
You can disable the unnecessary startup apps to save battery life. Some apps run in a startup even we don’t need it, they can drain more battery life. Disable each in every app you don’t need. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc > Startup.
